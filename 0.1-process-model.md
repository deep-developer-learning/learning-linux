Linux Process Model and Execution

- Visualize and track process trees
- Observe fork() and exec() behavior
- Trap and handle signals in a shell script
- Explore and manipulate file descriptors
- Create and observe zombie/orphan processes

Interesting commands I came across:

`echo $$` # print current shell's PID

List interesting thigns about running processes
`ps -ef`
`ps -aux`
`ps -ef --forest` # prings the processes to show which process created it. Very useful

Now run a kind cluster.
This spins a bunch of pods by defualt. Also run some nginx container with some replica sets like this:
`kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/deployment.yaml`
`ps -ef --forest` # to see which processes gets created. Nice way to see pause containers! This is neat!

Copy the PID into some var.
pid=<some pid>
`readlink /proc/$pid/exe` # shows where the exe is running from
`sudo strings /proc/$pid/environ` # shows environment vars used by the process
`sudo cat /proc/$pid/exe` # See the actual binary
`sudo strings /proc/$pid/stat` # See process status

System Calls
`strace ls` # Prints all system calls for the ls command.
